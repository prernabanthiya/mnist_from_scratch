# mnist_from_scratch
This repository contains a 2-layer neural network built from scratch using only NumPy, without any deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The goal is to understand the mathematics behind neural networks, including forward propagation, backpropagation, activation functions, and gradient descent.
